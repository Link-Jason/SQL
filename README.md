# Jason Link's SQL portfolio

Hey there! Check Check out my SQL portfolio. I've included some examples of my SQL coding so far. When I first started in January (2023), I had no clue what SQL even was. There's still a lot for me to learn as I continue to figure this out, but I'm proud of the progress I've made so far. Thanks for taking a peek at my journey!
