Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This collection showcases my journey in the world of SQL, where I've grown from a complete beginner to confidently tackling queries that join multiple tables using different keys.
Feel free to browse through my projects and  don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
