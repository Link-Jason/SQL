# Jason Link's SQL portfolio

Check Check out my SQL portfolio. I've included some examples of my SQL coding so far. When I first started in January, (2023) I had no clue what SQL even was. There's still a lot for me to learn, but I'm proud of the progress I've made. Thanks for taking a peek at my journey!
